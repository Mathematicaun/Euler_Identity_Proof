# Euler's Identity Visualization

This repository contains a Manim script to visualize Euler's Identity. Euler's Identity is a beautiful equation in mathematics that shows the deep relationship between the most fundamental constants in mathematics. The identity is given by:

$e^{i\pi}+1=0$

## Description

The provided code generates an animation demonstrating Euler's Identity using the Manim library. The animation includes:

- Displaying Euler's Identity.
- Visualizing the proof using Taylor series expansion.
- Showing how the formula relates to trigonometric functions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [ManimCE](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/) (Community Edition)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
